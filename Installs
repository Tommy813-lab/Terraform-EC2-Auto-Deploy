ðŸ”§ Installs & Prerequisites
By Charles â€” Aspiring Cloud Engineer

Before you launch your AWS EC2 instance and run your startup scripts, make sure youâ€™ve got these essential tools installed and ready to roll on your local machine or cloud terminal:

âœ… 1. AWS CLI
Your go-to tool for managing AWS from the command line â€” authenticates you and handles credentials.

Install AWS CLI:

bash
Copy code
# macOS
brew install awscli

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install awscli -y

# Windows (PowerShell)
choco install awscli
Configure AWS credentials:

bash
Copy code
aws configure
Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter:

AWS Access Key ID

AWS Secret Access Key

Default region (e.g., us-east-1)

Output format (e.g., json)

âœ… 2. SSH Key Pair
Youâ€™ll need a valid EC2 key pair to securely SSH into your instance.

Create a new SSH key pair locally:

bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f my-key
Upload the generated .pem (private key) or .pub (public key) file to AWS Console under EC2 > Key Pairs.

Keep your private key safeâ€”itâ€™s your golden ticket for logging in!

âœ… 3. (Optional) Git
If you want to clone or push your project repo:

bash
Copy code
# macOS
brew install git

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install git -y

# Windows (PowerShell)
choco install git
ðŸ§ª Verify Youâ€™re Set
Run these commands to check your AWS CLI and SSH setup:

bash
Copy code
aws sts get-caller-identity
ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<YOUR_INSTANCE_IP>
If you get your AWS account info and connect to your instance, youâ€™re golden.

Once youâ€™ve got this sorted, youâ€™re all set to launch your EC2 instance with your startup script, automate software installs, and own the cloud like a pro.
