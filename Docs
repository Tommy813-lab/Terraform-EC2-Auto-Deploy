🧩 Components Breakdown
Component	Purpose
EC2 Instance	Virtual server launched with your chosen AMI
Startup Script	Runs at first boot to install and configure software
Security Group	Controls network access (SSH, HTTP/HTTPS)
IAM Role	Optional — grants AWS permissions if needed
SSH Key Pair	Secure login credentials to access the instance

🛠️ Workflow Steps
Launch your EC2 Instance

Use AWS Console, CLI, or SDK

Attach your startup script as user data

Instance Initialization

On first boot, the user data script runs automatically

It installs necessary software and configures the environment

Connect and Verify

SSH into the instance with your key pair

Verify your app or web server is running
